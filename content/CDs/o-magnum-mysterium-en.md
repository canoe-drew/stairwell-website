<h3>‘O Magnum Mysterium’ – Stairwell Carollers, directed by Pierre Massie.</h3>
<h4>Review by Mark Hewitt</h4>
<p>
The Stairwell Carollers’ new disc ‘<i>O Magnum
Mysterium</i>’ is the choir’s eighth album and is a very
generously filled disc, nearly running to 80 minutes
of unaccompanied choral Christmas music. This
Canadian choir, based in Ottawa, was founded in
1977 by their musical director, Pierre Massie. The
choir has significant philanthropic credentials,
having raised substantial funds for local scholarships and charities.</p>
<p>
The choir’s musical credentials are no less impressive: they demonstrate secure intonation, clarity of diction, a warm tone and a rhythmic incisiveness. Pierre Massie draws some fine singing and a secure sense of ensemble from his choir. Even the most familiar carols are performed as if newly-minted.</p>
<p>
As well as founding and directing the Stairwell Carollers, Pierre Massie is also a composer and arranger. His compositions and arrangements are tailor-made for the choir and demonstrate a keen ear for choral texture, sample, for example, the playful scat-style singing in ‘Nouvelle Agreable’, the delightful bell chimes in ‘Venez divin Messie’ or ‘What Child Is This?’ with its ear- catching combination of drones and ‘Greensleeves’-like melody. The disc’s title ‘O Magnum Mysterium’ refers to Massie’s composition of the same name and is an impassioned
contemplation on the mystery of Christ’s birth and rings out with joyful ‘Alleluias’ at the work’s climax.</p>
<p>Amongst the British works on the disc, Herbert Howell’s ‘Here is the little door’ is given here a radiant and deeply expressive performance. The expansive tempo is highly successful in elevating this modest piece into something rich and resplendent. John Rutter’s ‘Dormi Jesu’ is sung with great sensitivity and tenderness.</p>
<p>Amongst the more familiar pieces is some less familiar fare, such as Peter Wishart’s ‘Alleluja, a new work is come on hand’. It is a measure of the choir’s technical prowess that they can successfully navigate the difficulties of this piece with great precision, clarity and flair. Another less-familiar work is John Tavener’s ‘Village Wedding’. Tavener sets fragments of a poem by Sikilanos and Isaiah’s dance from the orthodox wedding service, making a feature of contrasting passages of homophony with folk-like heterophony and is touchingly performed by the choir.</p>
<p>The whole disc is a cornucopia of musical delights, both familiar and unfamiliar and such is the variety of the programming and the creativity of interpretation and execution that the disc is a real listening pleasure from beginning to end. A resounding success!</p>

## A word from our Director...

As we enter our 38th season of singing in Ottawa/Gatineau, I look back with pride on the Stairwell Carollers' accomplishments.
We started in 1977, singing in the residence stairwells of Ottawa University and went on to sing unpaid on buses and in the
streets, in hospitals, hospices, nursing homes, malls and more. Our fundraising began in 1986 with a CFMO recording on vinyl,
entitled "_Christmas with the Stairwell Carollers_" which raised over $55,000 for Ronald McDonald House. Ten years later, with
the release of our first CD "_Qui creavit celum_", our philanthropic mandate was set. Our total is now over $122,000 in donations
and music scholarships to more than 30 local charitable groups and university students.

I thank all who have been part of this journey since my choir's humble heginnings. Some have been along for the ride from the
start, many others have sung with us for over 22 years.

Since our last CD, the Carollers once again placed first in the Ontario Music Festival Association 2013 provincial competition.
_Eya, ega, gaudeamus_ also placed first in the Amadeus Choir Carol Competition. My composition _Mourning Dove_ has been
performed on the Canada Peace Tower carillon many times, along with my arrangements of _Wassail Song_ and _Ça bergers, assemblons nous_.

_O magnum mysterium_ is our 5th Christmas CD; the title track is my 9th original composition. Now that I'm retired from
teaching I hope to create many more compositions and arrangements for my choir to perform.

The Stairwell Carollers continue to spread the joy of the season with Christmas carol concerts. In spring, sacred and secular songs from
the Medieval era to present day are our focus, sung to a growing audience in the Ottawa/Gatineau area.

This CD is a celebration of these achievements, and l offer it to you with my best wishes.

Watch for our next CD in 2018!
